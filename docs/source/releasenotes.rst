Version 0.9
-----------

Eskapade-ROOT v0.9 (December 2018) contains several small updates compared with v0.8:

* All code has been updated to Eskapade v0.9, where the core functionality has been split off into the Eskapade-Core package. As such the code is backwards-incompatible with v0.8.
* The link RoofitPercentileBinning has an option for a default number of bins.
* Several minor updates to the UncorrelationHypothesisTester link, in particular the options to store the correlation and significance matrices.


Version 0.8
-----------

Version 0.8 of Eskapade-ROOT (August 2018) is a split off of the ``root-analysis`` module of Eskapade v0.7
into a separate package. 

This way, Eskapade v0.8 no longer depends on ROOT. This new package Eskapade-ROOT does require ROOT to install, clearly.
